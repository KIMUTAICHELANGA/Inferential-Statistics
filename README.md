Statistical Test Project: Hypothesis Testing and Population Proportions Analysis
Introduction
Hypothesis testing is a fundamental tool in inferential statistics used to determine the value of a population parameter based on sample data analysis. This project focuses on conducting hypothesis tests and analyzing population proportions using Python, particularly leveraging the statsmodels library.

Overview
The primary components of hypothesis testing covered in this project include:

Null Hypothesis:
The null hypothesis represents the default assumption that there is no significant difference or effect.
Alternative Hypothesis:
The alternative hypothesis presents the assertion or claim that contradicts the null hypothesis.
The statistical tests discussed in this project are:

One Population Proportion
Difference in Population Proportions
Tools and Libraries Used
The project utilizes the following Python libraries:

statsmodels: Provides functions for conducting various statistical tests and analyses.
numpy: Used for numerical computing and handling arrays.
matplotlib: Employed for data visualization and plotting.
pandas: Utilized for data manipulation and analysis.
Statistical Tests Covered
One Population Proportion
Research Question:
Is there an increase in the percentage of parents believing that electronics and social media cause their teenager’s lack of sleep compared to previous years?

Population: Parents with teenagers aged 13-18
Parameter of Interest: Proportion (p)
Null Hypothesis: p = 0.52
Alternative Hypothesis: p > 0.52 (one-sided test)
Difference in Population Proportions
Research Question:
Is there a significant difference between the population proportions of parents of black children and parents of Hispanic children reporting that their child has had some swimming lessons?

Populations: All parents of black children aged 6-18 and all parents of Hispanic children aged 6-18
Parameter of Interest: Difference in proportions (p1 - p2)
Null Hypothesis: p1 - p2 = 0
Alternative Hypothesis: p1 - p2 ≠ 0
